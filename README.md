renderGraph
=======

This is a test for a component that adds graph or network representations to interactive web applications developed with R and Shiny.

Made with [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

Original idea: ['Reconstruct Gene Networks'](http://trestletechnology.net/2012/12/reconstruct-gene-networks/) by Jeff Allen.

shiny :: runGitHub('renderGraph', 'mfontcada')
